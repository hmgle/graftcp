# GRAFTCP

`graftcp` is a proxy tool inspiring by [maybe](https://github.com/p-e-w/maybe) and [proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains).
It hooks `connect(2)` function via `ptrace(2)` and redirects the connection through SOCKS5 proxies.

## Introduction

`graftcp` can redirect the TCP connection made by the given program \[application, script, shell, etc.\] to SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy.

Compared with [tsocks](https://linux.die.net/man/8/tsocks), [proxychains](http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/) or [proxychains-ng](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng), `graftcp` is not using the [LD_PRELOAD trick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/426230/what-is-the-ld-preload-trick) which only work for dynamically linked programs, e.g., [applications built by Go can not be hook by proxychains-ng](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng/issues/199). `graftcp` can trace or modify any
given program's connect by [`ptrace(2)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace), so it is workable for any program. The principle will be explained in this paragraph of [how does it work](#principles).

## Installation

### Install from source

`graftcp` runs on Linux. Building `graftcp-local` requires [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed. 

For snap installation on ubuntu 20.04/ 18.04:
```sh

### snap download is very slow especially in China. To speedup snap download, install snap-store-proxy.  
# Ubuntu 20.04/18.04 has snap installed. othervise, you have to install snap first. 
# sudo apt-get install snapd
# sudo snap install snap-store

sudo snap install snap-store-proxy
sudo snap install snap-store-proxy-client

# install go package
sudo snap install --classic go

```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hmgle/graftcp.git
cd graftcp
make
```

After make finishes, you'll be able to use `local/graftcp-local` and `./graftcp`.
Optionally, you can also install them to system:

```sh
sudo make install
# Install systemed unit
sudo make install_systemd
# Activate systemd service
sudo make enable_systemd
```

### Install from binary package

Download the [Debian](https://github.com/hmgle/graftcp/releases/download/v0.4.0/graftcp_0.4.0-1_amd64.deb) or [Arch Linux](https://github.com/hmgle/graftcp/releases/download/v0.4.0/graftcp-0.4.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst) package from <https://github.com/hmgle/graftcp/releases> and install.

```

### Configuration

`graftcp-local` and `mgraftcp` look for config file in following order:

1. File provided as a `--config` argument
2. `$(the path of the executeable)/graftcp-local.conf`
3. `$(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/graftcp-local/graftcp-local.conf`, If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is either not set or empty, a default equal to `$HOME/.config` should be used.
4. `/etc/graftcp-local/graftcp-local.conf`

## Demo

Configuration:
--------------

proxychains looks for config file in following order:
1)	file listed in environment variable PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE or
	provided as a -f argument to proxychains script or binary.
2)	./proxychains.conf
3)	$(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
4)	$(sysconfdir)/proxychains.conf  **

** usually /etc/proxychains???.conf

??? the following is for your reference. Proxychains-ng has excellent documents, newbies like me can follow and configure. 
Configuration file template, refer to https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng
/etc/proxychains.conf

```sh
# ProxyList format
#       type  ip  port [user pass]
#       (values separated by 'tab' or 'blank')
#
#       only numeric ipv4 addresses are valid
#
#
#        Examples:
#
#            	socks5	192.168.67.78	1080	lamer	secret
#		          http	  192.168.89.3	8080	justu	hidden
#	 	          socks4	192.168.1.49	1080
#	            http	  192.168.39.93	8080	
#		
#
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5
#        ( auth types supported: "basic"-http  "user/pass"-socks )
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
# socks5 	127.0.0.1 9050 username password
```

Usage Example:
  Set your SOCKS5 proxy. ?? Ask your service provider for host, port, user name and password or you are lucky to have free SOCKS5 account??
  Suppose your SOCKS5 proxy:127.0.0.63:1080, username=Shanghai, password=123456 
	???????????

in this example, you define your proxy in proxychains.conf???

Usage Example:

	$ proxychains -f /etc/proxychains-other.conf telnet targethost2.com

in this example it will use different configuration file then proxychains.conf
to connect to targethost2.com host.

Usage Example:

When the SOCKS5 proxy has been setted,  Start the `graftcp-local` first:

```sh
local/graftcp-local
```
Usage Example:

Install the Go package from golang.org (now is blocked by the GFW) via `graftcp`:

```sh
./graftcp go get -v golang.org/x/net/proxy
```
Usage Example:

Open `Chromium` / `Chrome` / `Firefox` browser via `graftcp`, then all the requests from this browser will redirect to the SOCKS5 proxy:

```sh
./graftcp chromium-browser
```
Usage Example:
Launch `Bash` / `Zsh` / `Fish` via `graftcp`, then all the TCP traffic generated by the command in this shell will redirect to the SOCKS5 proxy:

```console
% ./graftcp bash --rcfile <(echo 'PS1="(graftcp) $PS1"')
(graftcp) $ wget https://www.google.com
```

## How does it work?

To achieve the goal of redirecting the TCP connection of a app to another destination address and the app itself is not aware of it, these conditions are probably required:

- `fork(2)` a new process and trace it using `ptrace(2)`, `execve(2)` to run the app. Every `connect(2)` syscall will be intercepted, then get the destination address argument and send it to `graftcp-local` via `pipe`.
- Modify the destination address argument of `connect(2)` to `graftcp-local`'s address, and restart the stopped syscall. After the syscall returns successfully, the app thought it has connected the original destination address, but in fact it is connected to the `graftcp-local`, so we named it "graft".
- `graftcp-local` establish a SOCKS5 connection based on the information of app's original destination address, then redirect the requests from the app to the SOCKS5 proxy.

Someone may have a question here: since we can modify the arguments of a syscall, modify the app's `write(2)` / `send(2)` buf argument, attach the original destination information to the `write` buffer, isn't it simpler? The answer is that cannot be done. Because attach data to the buffer of the tracked child process, it may case a buffer overflow, causing crash or overwrite other data.
In addition, as the [`execve(2)` will detach and unmap all shared memory](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html), we also cannot add extra data to the `write` buffer of traced app by sharing memory, so we send the original destination address via `pipe`.

The simple sketch is as follows:

```

## FAQ and Tips

### What are some ways to redirect TCP connections?

The main ones are: global way, environment variables setting way, and programs selection way.

Global way: e.g., use `iptables` + `RedSocks` to convert the system's traffic that match certain rules into SOCKS5 traffic. The pros is that it is globally effective; the cons is that all traffic that satisfies the rule is redirected, and the scope of influence is large.

Environment variable setting: some programs will read the proxy-related environment variables to determine whether to convert their own traffic to the corresponding proxy protocol traffic, such as `curl` will [read `http_proxy`, `ftp_proxy`, `all_proxy` Environment variables and decide which proxy traffic to convert based on the request URL scheme](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html). This way is effective only if the program itself implements the traffic conversion function, so
it is very limited.

programs selection way: this way can only perform redirection for specified programs, such as `tsocks` or `proxychains`. As mentioned earlier, they were using the `LD_PRELOAD` hijacking dynamic library function, and the default static link compiled program such as `Go` is invalid. `graftcp` improves this by being able to redirect TCP connections from any program.

### Will `graftcp` redirect the connection to the SOCKS5 proxy if the target address is localhost?

No. By default, `graftcp` ignore the connections to localhost. If you want to redirect all addresses, you can use the `-n` option. If you want to ignore more addresses, you can add them to the blacklist IP file; if you want to redirect only certain IP addresses, you can add them to the whitelist IP file. Use `graftcp --help` to get more information.

### I am suffering a DNS cache poisoning attack, does `graftcp` handle DNS requests?

No. `graftcp` currently only handles TCP connections. [`dnscrypt-proxy`](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy) or `ChinaDNS` may help you.

### Running `[m]graftcp yay` or `graftcp sudo ...` results in an error and exit, how to solve this?

The `yay` command on Arch Linux actually invokes `sudo pacman ...`, which requires the tracer to have root privileges to obtain permissions to trace the child process. You can start `[m]graftcp` with `sudo` and specify the current user to run the subsequent command: `sudo [m]graftcp sudo -u $USER yay`, or `sudo [m]graftcp -u $USER sudo ...`.

If you feel the above command too long, you can copy a `[m]graftcp` binary with CAP_SYS_PTRACE and CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities:

```sh
cp mgraftcp sumg
sudo setcap 'cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_admin+ep' ./sumg
# ./sumg yay
# ./sumg sudo ...
```

### The `clone(2)`'s argument has a flag `CLONE_UNTRACED` to avoid being traced, how does `graftcp` do forced tracing?

`graftcp` will intercept the `clone(2)` syscall, and clearing the `CLONE_UNTRACED` flag, so the tracked child process could not escape the fate of being tracked. In addition, this `CLONE_UNTRACED` flag is intended for the kernel, and user space program should not set it.

Linux provides a way to limit the `ptrace(2)`: set the value of [`/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt). If `ptrace(2)` is invalid, check if the default value has been modified.

### Does it support macOS?

No. macOS's [`ptrace(2)`](http://polarhome.com/service/man/?qf=ptrace&af=0&sf=0&of=Darwin&tf=2) is useless. ~~However, it can also be achieved theoretically by referring to `DTrace`~~. See [issue 12](https://github.com/hmgle/graftcp/issues/12).
